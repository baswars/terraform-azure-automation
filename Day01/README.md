Terraform Configuration for Azure Resource Group
This Terraform configuration sets up an Azure environment by defining a resource group in the East US region. This is a basic example to get you started with Terraform and Azure.

Prerequisites
Before using this configuration, ensure you have:

An Azure account.
Terraform installed on your local machine.
Azure CLI installed and authenticated.
Configuration Details
Terraform Block
The terraform block specifies the required providers and their versions. In this configuration, we are using the Azure Resource Manager (azurerm) provider.

terraform {
  required_providers {
    azurerm = {
      source  = "hashicorp/azurerm"
      version = ">=3.0.0"
    }
  }
}
required_providers: Specifies the providers Terraform needs.
azurerm: The Azure Resource Manager provider.
source: Indicates the provider source, which is hashicorp/azurerm.
version: Specifies the version constraint. Here, it requires version 3.0.0 or above.
Provider Block
The provider block configures the specified provider. In this case, it's configuring the Azure provider.

provider "azurerm" {
  features {}
}
provider "azurerm": Configures the Azure Resource Manager provider.
features {}: This block is required but can be left empty unless specific features need to be configured.
Resource Block
The resource block defines the resources to be created. Here, we are creating an Azure Resource Group.


resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg" {
  name     = "rg-vm"
  location = "East US"
}
resource "azurerm_resource_group" "rg": Defines an Azure Resource Group resource.
name: The name of the resource group (rg-vm).
location: The Azure region where the resource group will be created (East US).
